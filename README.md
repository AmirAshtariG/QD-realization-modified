# Q-D realization software
This repository contains a MATLAB application which which computes multipath components between communicating nodesthanks to raytracing.

## Features:

1. Generates specular rays which are dependent on the CAD model of the environment under consideration.
1. Generates nodes either randomly or based on a user-specific placement.
1. Accounts for mobility of the nodes in the environment using a random waypoint model.
1. Generates diffuse rays.
1. Can deal with multiple nodes in the environment.
