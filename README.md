# Q-D realization software
This repository contains a MATLAB application which computes multipath components characteristics between communicating nodes thanks to raytracing and Q-D methodology.

## Features:

1. Generates specular rays which are dependent on the CAD model of the environment under consideration.
1. Generates nodes either randomly or based on a user-specific placement.
1. Accounts for mobility of the nodes in the environment using a random waypoint model.
1. Generates diffuse rays.
1. Can deal with multiple nodes in the environment.

# Author Information:
The Q-D Realization software is developed by [Anuraag Bodi](https://www.nist.gov/people/anuraag-bodi) and maintained by [Tanguy Ropitault](https://www.nist.gov/people/tanguy-ropitault).

The current version of the code has been developed in collaboration with University of Padova, Department of Information Engineering, [SIGNET lab.](http://signet.dei.unipd.it/), under Prof. [Michele Zorzi](mailto:zorzi@dei.unipd.it)'s supervision.
