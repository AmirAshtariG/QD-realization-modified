# Q-D realization software
This repository contains a MATLAB application which computes multipath components characteristics between communicating nodes thanks to raytracing and Q-D methodology.

## Features:

1. Generates specular rays which are dependent on the CAD model of the environment under consideration.
1. Generates nodes either randomly or based on a user-specific placement.
1. Accounts for mobility of the nodes in the environment using a random waypoint model.
1. Generates diffuse rays.
1. Can deal with multiple nodes in the environment.

Here is a sample snapshot for our Q-D realization software:
